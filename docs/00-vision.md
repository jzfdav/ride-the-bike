# Vision: RideTheBike

## Problem Statement
A 2018 Pulsar 180 is sitting idle because the owner (a developer and father of two) naturally prioritizes the family car (Honda Amaze) for comfort and safety. Infrequent usage (300-500km in 6 months) is detrimental to the bike's battery and engine health.

## Goal
To reach 13,000 km in 3 months (from 10,000 km) by gamifying "mechanical sympathy." The app encourages frequent, short local rides to keep the machine "alive" and ready.

## Target Audience
The owner (self) and other "neglectful" bike enthusiasts who love their machines but forget to ride them.

## Key Success Metrics
- Average weekly riding frequency > 3 times.
- Reaching the 13k odometer mark by the 90-day deadline.
- Maintaining "Battery Health" status at 100%.
